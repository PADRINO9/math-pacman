# Kaflul UI Next Level - Phase 0 Plan For Later Phases

Date: 2026-06-28
Scope: Planning only. Do not treat this as implementation approval.

## Guiding Constraints

- Preserve gameplay behavior.
- Preserve save and leaderboard data.
- Preserve canvas coordinate assumptions.
- Preserve Bifly and Nabatick IDs.
- Preserve Arcade and Adventure modes.
- Preserve five difficulty IDs and Legendary unlock behavior.
- Preserve question/scoring/combo/lives/mission behavior.
- Keep Hebrew RTL as the primary interface direction.
- Mobile portrait is the primary target.
- Do not remove legacy files until Phase 1 verifies usage.

## Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1 - Foundation And Cleanup

Goal: make the existing UI safe to change without altering behavior.

Work:

- Create a CSS ownership map and mark each file as base, mobile patch, feature, or candidate obsolete.
- Add a visual regression harness for the five required viewport sizes.
- Add mobile character-selection interaction coverage.
- Introduce design tokens for spacing, color, z-index, radius, shadow, type, and motion.
- Create an asset manifest document.
- Define a single owner for start-screen/menu CSS.
- Add safe wrappers around UI state changes without changing gameplay.

Acceptance criteria:

- Existing Node tests pass.
- Browser smoke tests pass in an environment with Playwright browsers installed.
- Baseline screenshots can be regenerated.
- No save data keys are renamed or removed.
- No gameplay values change.
- Obsolete candidates are documented, not deleted blindly.

### Phase 2 - Home Hub

Goal: rebuild the main menu as a production-grade game hub using the existing logic.

Work:

- Redesign home layout around logo, character selection, start CTA, score/rank preview, and control strip.
- Replace Unicode glyphs with real icons.
- Fix Bifly/Nabatick character scale, crop, and selected state.
- Preserve existing radio inputs or equivalent accessible controls.
- Preserve `setCharacter`, `setMode`, `setDifficulty`, and local save behavior.

- Start button remains clear and reachable.
- Mode, difficulty, and nickname remain editable.
- Leaderboard preview remains functional.
- Screenshots pass at 390x844, 430x932, 844x390, 1280x720, and 1440x900.

### Phase 3 - Hero And World Presentation

Goal: make the first screen feel like a polished original Kaflul game world.

Work:

- Establish an original art direction using the official logo and character assets.
- Introduce character-safe hero composition.
- Introduce world/progression hints without changing gameplay rules.
- Replace generic atmospheric layering with a coherent world scene.

Acceptance criteria:

- Mobile portrait remains uncluttered.
- No stock-like or generic UI art dominates the screen.
- Asset loading remains within agreed performance budget.

### Phase 4 - Gameplay HUD

Goal: modernize HUD and question overlays without touching gameplay math or movement.

Work:

- Redesign HUD as a compact mobile-first overlay.

Acceptance criteria:

- Canvas gameplay remains unchanged.
- Question flow, answer timing, and scoring remain unchanged.
- HUD does not block critical maze visibility.
- Mobile portrait and landscape both remain playable.
- Pause/resume tests pass.

### Phase 5 - Secondary Screens

Goal: make results, leaderboard, settings, difficulty, mode, and mission screens feel consistent.

Work:

- Redesign modal/sheet system with shared tokens.
- Improve results hierarchy and replay flow.
- Improve leaderboard filters and empty states.
- Improve settings/nickname form.
- Verify focus handling and escape/close behavior.

Acceptance criteria:

- All dialogs have accessible names.
- Keyboard/focus behavior is predictable.
- Leaderboard filters still work.
- Score publishing still works.
- Result values match pre-redesign behavior.

### Phase 6 - Motion And Audio

Goal: add premium feedback without reducing clarity or performance.

Work:

- Define motion tokens for selection, button press, answer feedback, screen transitions, and combo.
- Replace uncontrolled infinite animation with purposeful motion.
- Keep reduced-motion behavior.

- Performance remains acceptable on mobile.

### Phase 7 - QA, Performance, And Polish

Goal: release-ready confidence.

Work:

- Run full automated tests.
- Run screenshot comparisons for required viewports.
- Test real mobile portrait and landscape.
- Verify Vercel deployment output.
- Check accessibility basics.
- Measure initial payload and rendering performance.
- Confirm no console errors.

Acceptance criteria:

- Node and browser tests pass.
- Required viewport screenshots approved.
- No known blocking console/runtime errors.
- No unintended save/leaderboard migration.
- No UI overlap in required viewports.
- Vercel production deployment succeeds.

## Quick Wins For Later Phases

- Replace menu glyphs with real icons.
- Fix Nabatick menu positioning/safe area.
- Add a `npm run screenshot:baseline` or equivalent local command.
- Add a mobile character-selection smoke test.
- Document CSS file ownership in comments or docs before deleting anything.
- Reduce first-load image weight with optimized variants.

## Major Refactors For Later Phases

- Split `game.js` into gameplay core, rendering, UI state, and persistence modules.

- Replace `nabatick-directional.js` monkeypatch with explicit sprite selection.
- Move UI metadata into a single config/model consumed by menu, HUD, results, and leaderboard.
- Create a stable asset manifest and loader priority model.

## Testing Plan

Required automated checks:

- Existing Node tests.
- Existing Playwright smoke tests.
- New screenshot baseline across required viewport matrix.
- Character selection interaction on mobile.
- Mode and difficulty selection.
- Start game from menu.
- Question dialog input on mobile.
- Pause/resume.
- Results screen and leaderboard open/close.

Required manual checks:

- iPhone-size portrait.
- Large phone portrait.
- Short landscape.
- 1280x720 desktop.
- 1440x900 desktop.
- Hebrew RTL text and numeric ordering.
- Reduced-motion mode.
- Sound on/off behavior.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CSS cascade conflicts across ten stylesheets | High | Phase 1 ownership map and visual baseline before edits. |
| `game.js` owns too many responsibilities | High | Extract only after tests exist; preserve public state paths. |
| Save/leaderboard behavior regression | High | Keep storage keys, add fixture tests before UI refactor. |
| Mobile character-selection flicker | High | Reproduce with recording and add regression coverage. |
| Nabatick asset confusion | Medium | Asset manifest and safe-area standard. |
| Heavy first-load assets | Medium | Optimize/defer with measured budget. |
| Dialog accessibility gaps | Medium | Add focus-management tests. |
| Playwright browser missing locally | Medium | Install/cache browser in dev/CI environment before relying on full suite. |
| Workflows that can mutate branches | Medium | Review before Phase 1 cleanup touches tool/workflow paths. |

## Assumptions

- The current root-level static file structure is intentional for Vercel.
- The current local save schema must remain backward compatible.
- Bifly and Nabatick are both required playable characters.
- Arcade and Adventure both remain in scope.
- The five current difficulties are final product concepts.
- The official logo supplied by the user is the preferred logo source.
- No Phase 1 implementation should start until this Phase 0 documentation is reviewed.

## Phase 1 Completion Notes

Phase 1 implemented the foundation and cleanup layer only. It did not begin the Phase 2 home hub redesign.

Completed:

- Central design tokens and reusable component foundations in `ui/foundation.css`.
- Reduced-motion foundation in the same cascade layer.
- SVG icon sprite foundation in `ui/icons.svg`.
- Asset manifest foundation in `ui/assets/asset-manifest.js`.
- Mobile CSS cascade boundary in `ui/mobile-overrides.css`.
- Top-level stylesheet link reduction from 10 to 6.
- Visual-regression and acceptance script in `tools/phase1_visual_regression.mjs`.
- Updated tests to avoid depending on Unicode pause/sound glyphs.
- Added persistence smoke coverage for character, mode, difficulty, nickname, and sound state.

Deferred to later phases:

- Home screen redesign.
- Character screen redesign.
- Gameplay HUD redesign.
- Full motion system.
- Full UI sound system.
- Deleting legacy hotfix files.
- Removing all remaining Unicode fallback glyphs from dynamic gameplay text.

Phase 2 may start only after Phase 1 is reviewed and accepted.

## Phase 2 Completion Notes

Phase 2 redesigned only the home screen as a premium, mobile-first Kaflul game hub. It did not redesign the dedicated character screen, gameplay HUD, question dialog, pause screen, results screen, leaderboard, or later-phase motion/audio systems.

Completed:

- Rebuilt the home screen hierarchy around a compact top player bar, central living hero scene, primary `שחק עכשיו` action, pre-game summary controls, and bottom navigation.
- Integrated the official Kaflul logo, Bifly, Nabatick, black enemies, maze routes, ambient particles, and four-world hints into the home scene.
- Preserved existing IDs and state paths for character, mode, difficulty, nickname, sound, leaderboard, and start-game behavior.
- Added static future-facing character animation hooks with `data-character-state` and `data-animation-state`.
- Added focused home navigation behavior for `משחק`, `דמויות`, `התקדמות`, and `אלופים`.
- Added `tools/phase2_home_verification.mjs` for required viewport screenshots, console/runtime checks, RTL checks, touch/keyboard checks, persistence checks, and start/return smoke coverage.
- Added Phase 2 screenshot artifacts under `docs/phase2-screenshots/`.
- Fixed the home rank button conflict with `leaderboard.css` by scoping the home rank button back into the top player bar.

Deferred to later phases:

- Full character animation state system.
- Dedicated character-management screen redesign.
- Gameplay HUD redesign.
- Full audio feedback system.
- World-specific animated background art.
- Replacing low-resolution or reference-only character art with production-ready sprite sheets.

Phase 3 must not assume unsupported progression data. Progress surfaces should continue to show only verified save/leaderboard information.

## Phase 3 Completion Notes

Phase 3 built the dedicated Bifly/Nabatick hero gallery only. It did not begin Phase 4, change gameplay rules, redesign the gameplay HUD, or add unsupported progression data.

Completed:

- Added a full-screen premium hero gallery launched from the home hub character controls.
- Added large selected-character presentation, Hebrew name, short personality copy, character-specific lighting, black enemies, maze route decoration, previous/next controls, select confirmation, and return-to-home flow.
- Added keyboard navigation, touch swipe navigation, tap reaction, entrance animation, and reduced-motion-compatible fallbacks.
- Preserved character gameplay behavior; both characters still use the existing `setCharacter` path and persisted storage.
- Added `ui/character-animation-adapter.js` supporting `static-png`, `sprite-sheet`, `layered-png-rig`, `rive`, and `spine` adapter paths without paid-tool requirements.
- Updated `ui/assets/asset-manifest.js` with Phase 3 character-animation metadata.
- Added `tools/phase3_hero_verification.mjs` and required hero-gallery screenshot artifacts.
- Updated Phase 2 home verification to treat the new character gallery as the expected character-control destination.

Deferred to later phases:

- Production sprite sheets or layered PNG rigs.
- Real blink, tap, selected, excited, worried, victory, defeat, and hit animation assets.
- Full motion system.
- Full audio asset system.
- Dedicated gameplay HUD redesign.
- Any Phase 4 work.

Phase 4 may start only after the Phase 3 gallery, asset manifest, and QA report are reviewed and accepted.

## Phase 4 Completion Notes

Phase 4 redesigned only the gameplay HUD. It did not change scoring rules, lives rules, combo rules, mission logic, progression logic, question generation, enemy behavior, movement behavior, win/loss conditions, save schema, or leaderboard behavior.

Completed:

- Rebuilt the always-visible HUD around score, combo, lives, wave/level progress, current mission, pause, and sound.
- Moved mode, difficulty, world, level number, and detailed mission context out of the always-visible HUD into secondary/pause-context surfaces.
- Replaced gameplay life hearts with SVG sprite icons from the existing icon infrastructure.
- Added HUD feedback hooks for score changes, combo milestones, life loss/gain, mission progress, mission completion, and wave/level progress.
- Added accessible progressbar metadata and readable pause/sound control labels.
- Added responsive HUD layouts for mobile portrait, mobile landscape, and desktop while keeping the canvas/playfield visually dominant.
- Added `tools/phase4_hud_verification.mjs` for required viewport screenshots, console/runtime checks, RTL checks, HUD visibility checks, FPS sampling, and gameplay-session acceptance.
- Added Phase 4 screenshot artifacts under `docs/phase4-screenshots/`.

Gameplay-adjacent but non-rule changes:

- The pause canvas overlay now displays secondary context: mode, difficulty, world, mission progress, and resume instructions.
- Mobile gameplay stage sizing is forced to the full visual viewport while the start screen is hidden, so the maze remains dominant behind the compact HUD.
- Arcade HUD progress now displays current wave progress out of the wave target instead of total correct answers; total correct-answer state remains unchanged internally.

Deferred to later phases:

- Full motion system.
- Full audio asset system.
- Gameplay character animation upgrades.
- Results screen redesign.
- Question-dialog redesign.
- World transition presentation redesign.

Phase 5 must not assume any gameplay-rule change from Phase 4. Phase 4 is a visual and interaction-shell HUD phase only.
