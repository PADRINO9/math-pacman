## Automated Checks

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct JS syntax checks | Pass | `kaflul-systems.js`, `game.js`, `mobile-enhancements.js`, `poster-loader.js`, `ui/assets/asset-manifest.js`, `tools/phase1_visual_regression.mjs`. |
| Node systems tests | Pass | 11/11 in `tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`. |
| Phase 1 visual regression | Pass | Five required viewport screenshots captured and compared with Phase 0. |

## Required Viewport Screenshots

| Viewport | Phase 1 screenshot | Diff ratio vs Phase 0 |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| 390x844 portrait | `docs/phase1-screenshots/phase1-home-390x844-portrait.png` | 0.004639 |
| 430x932 portrait | `docs/phase1-screenshots/phase1-home-430x932-portrait.png` | 0.002356 |
| 844x390 landscape | `docs/phase1-screenshots/phase1-home-844x390-landscape.png` | 0.004417 |
| 1280x720 desktop | `docs/phase1-screenshots/phase1-home-1280x720-desktop.png` | 0.002509 |
| 1440x900 desktop | `docs/phase1-screenshots/phase1-home-1440x900-desktop.png` | 0.002137 |

Report file:

- `docs/phase1-screenshots/phase1-visual-report.json`

## Console And Runtime

The Phase 1 visual/acceptance pass reported:

- Console errors: 0
- Runtime errors: 0
- Document overflow at required viewport sizes: none
- Asset manifest loaded: yes

## Smoke Acceptance Details

All smoke checks passed:

- Character selection persisted.
- Mode selection persisted.
- Difficulty selection persisted.
- Nickname persisted.
- Sound state persisted.
- Mode sheet opened.
- Difficulty sheet opened.
- Settings sheet opened.
- Leaderboard opened.
- Game started.
- Pause/resume worked.
- Return to menu worked.

## Remaining QA Gaps

- Visual comparison currently covers the home/menu baseline and smoke flow, not every secondary screen screenshot.
- Real-device mobile testing is still required before later visual phases.
- Remaining Unicode fallback glyphs should be removed in later phases when the HUD/results redesigns are in scope.

## Phase 2 Home Hub QA Addendum

Date: 2026-06-28
Phase: 2 home screen redesign only

Automated checks:

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct JS syntax checks | Pass | `kaflul-systems.js`, `game.js`, `mobile-enhancements.js`, `poster-loader.js`, `ui/assets/asset-manifest.js`, `tools/phase1_visual_regression.mjs`, `tools/phase2_home_verification.mjs`. |
| Node systems tests | Pass | 11/11 in `tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`. |
| Phase 2 home verification | Pass | Required screenshots, console/runtime checks, overflow checks, RTL checks, touch, keyboard, persistence, leaderboard, start-game, and return-to-menu checks passed. |
| Local Playwright suite | Blocked | `node_modules/.bin/playwright` is not present in this local workspace and network install is unavailable. The Phase 2 CDP verifier covers the required home-specific browser checks. |

Required Phase 2 screenshots:

| Viewport | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| 390x844 portrait | `docs/phase2-screenshots/phase2-home-390x844-portrait.png` |
| 430x932 portrait | `docs/phase2-screenshots/phase2-home-430x932-portrait.png` |
| 844x390 landscape | `docs/phase2-screenshots/phase2-home-844x390-landscape.png` |
| 1280x720 desktop | `docs/phase2-screenshots/phase2-home-1280x720-desktop.png` |
| 1440x900 desktop | `docs/phase2-screenshots/phase2-home-1440x900-desktop.png` |

Report file:

- `docs/phase2-screenshots/phase2-home-report.json`

Phase 2 acceptance checks passed:

- Character selection and persistence.
- Mode selection and persistence.
- Difficulty selection and persistence.
- Nickname edit and persistence.
- Sound toggle and persistence.
- Settings open/close.
- Leaderboard open/close.
- Bottom navigation focus behavior.
- Keyboard focus reaches active controls.
- Touch interactions on mobile-sized viewport.
- Game starts from `שחק עכשיו`.
- Restart returns to the menu.
- Console errors: 0.
- Runtime errors: 0.
- Document overflow: none at all required viewports.
- Text overflow: none in checked home regions.

Manual screenshot inspection notes:

- 390x844 and 430x932 portrait are usable without accidental scrolling or clipped Hebrew.
- 844x390 landscape is dense but remains usable and fully in-bounds.
- 1280x720 and 1440x900 desktop keep the home scene readable with no detected clipping.
- The top player bar required a scoped override for `.home-rank-button.leaderboard-open-button`; the global leaderboard button style uses fixed positioning and would otherwise cover settings on mobile.

Commands run for Phase 2 QA included:

- `node --check` for production and verification scripts.
- `node --test tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`.
- `node tools/phase2_home_verification.mjs --ci`.
- Local Playwright binary check via `node_modules/.bin/playwright`.

## Phase 3 Hero Gallery QA Addendum

Date: 2026-06-28
Phase: 3 hero gallery only

Automated checks:

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct JS syntax checks | Pass | `kaflul-systems.js`, `game.js`, `mobile-enhancements.js`, `poster-loader.js`, `ui/assets/asset-manifest.js`, `ui/character-animation-adapter.js`, `tools/phase2_home_verification.mjs`, `tools/phase3_hero_verification.mjs`. |
| Node systems tests | Pass | 11/11 in `tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`. |
| Phase 2 home verification | Pass | Re-run after Phase 3; character navigation now verifies opening the hero gallery. |
| Phase 3 hero verification | Pass | Required screenshots, console/runtime checks, overflow checks, RTL checks, keyboard, touch swipe, persistence, image fit, and home-update checks passed. |
| `pnpm run build` / full Playwright suite | Blocked | No local `node_modules` install was present; `pnpm` attempted a registry install and failed under restricted network. The partial install artifacts were removed. |

Required Phase 3 screenshots:

| Viewport | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| 390x844 portrait | `docs/phase3-screenshots/phase3-hero-390x844-portrait.png` |
| 430x932 portrait | `docs/phase3-screenshots/phase3-hero-430x932-portrait.png` |
| 844x390 landscape | `docs/phase3-screenshots/phase3-hero-844x390-landscape.png` |
| 1280x720 desktop | `docs/phase3-screenshots/phase3-hero-1280x720-desktop.png` |
| 1440x900 desktop | `docs/phase3-screenshots/phase3-hero-1440x900-desktop.png` |

Report file:

- `docs/phase3-screenshots/phase3-hero-report.json`

Phase 3 acceptance checks passed:

- Gallery opens from the home hub.
- Bifly renders first from a clean local save.
- Next control reaches Nabatick.
- Tap reaction requests the `tap` state and falls back safely.
- Nabatick selection updates radio state, home label, and root character dataset.
- Return-to-home keeps the start screen visible.
- Selection persists after reload.
- Keyboard arrows navigate and Enter confirms.
- Touch swipe navigates.
- Console errors: 0.
- Runtime errors: 0.
- Document overflow: none at all required viewports.
- Text overflow: none in checked hero regions.
- Character image is complete, ratio-preserving, and inside the animation mount.
- Document language/direction remain `he`/`rtl`.

Manual screenshot inspection notes:

- 390x844 and 430x932 portrait are dense but usable without accidental scrolling or clipped Hebrew.
- 844x390 landscape remains in-bounds with primary selection action available.
- 1280x720 and 1440x900 desktop keep the character art large and undistorted.
- Current gallery screenshots use Bifly as the clean-save first character; scripted acceptance verifies browsing and selecting Nabatick.

Commands run for Phase 3 QA included:

- Direct `node --check` for production and verification scripts.
- `node --test tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`.
- `git diff --check`.
- `node tools/phase2_home_verification.mjs --ci`.
- `node tools/phase3_hero_verification.mjs --ci`.
- Attempted `pnpm run build`, blocked by restricted network while trying to install missing Playwright packages.

## Phase 4 Gameplay HUD QA Addendum

Date: 2026-06-28
Phase: 4 gameplay HUD only

Automated checks:

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct JS syntax checks | Pass | `game.js` and `tools/phase4_hud_verification.mjs` pass `node --check`. |
| Build-script syntax checks | Pass | The files named by the `build` script were checked individually with the bundled Node executable. |
| Node systems tests | Pass | 11/11 in `tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`. |
| Phase 4 HUD verification | Pass | Required screenshots, console/runtime checks, overflow checks, RTL checks, FPS sampling, touch/swipe, keyboard session, pause/resume, sound toggle, question dialog, correct answer, wrong answer, timeout, and game over passed. |
| Full package-manager run | Blocked | `pnpm run build` attempted to install missing Playwright packages from the registry and was stopped under restricted network. Partial install artifacts were removed. |

Required Phase 4 screenshots:

| Viewport | Screenshot | FPS |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| 390x844 portrait | `docs/phase4-screenshots/phase4-hud-390x844-portrait.png` | 87 |
| 430x932 portrait | `docs/phase4-screenshots/phase4-hud-430x932-portrait.png` | 83 |
| 844x390 landscape | `docs/phase4-screenshots/phase4-hud-844x390-landscape.png` | 97 |
| 1280x720 desktop | `docs/phase4-screenshots/phase4-hud-1280x720-desktop.png` | 47 |
| 1440x900 desktop | `docs/phase4-screenshots/phase4-hud-1440x900-desktop.png` | 40 |

Report file:

- `docs/phase4-screenshots/phase4-hud-report.json`

Phase 4 acceptance checks passed:

- Game started.
- Mobile swipe left gameplay running.
- Pause worked.
- Resume worked.
- Sound toggle worked.
- Question dialog opened.
- Correct answer worked.
- Wrong answer worked.
- Timeout was observed.
- Game over was observed.
- Console errors: 0.
- Runtime errors: 0.
- Document overflow: none at all required viewports.
- HUD out-of-bounds elements: 0.
- Checked HUD text overflow: 0.
- HUD screenshots were captured with the question dialog hidden.
- Document language/direction remained `he`/`rtl`.

Manual screenshot inspection notes:

- 390x844 and 430x932 portrait keep the maze visible behind a compact HUD; the mission and progress rail remain readable.
- 844x390 landscape keeps the HUD shallow enough that the playfield remains dominant.
- 1280x720 and 1440x900 desktop keep the HUD visually secondary to the canvas.
- Pause and sound controls remain readable without Unicode production icons.

Commands run for Phase 4 QA included:

- `node --check game.js`.
- `node --check tools/phase4_hud_verification.mjs`.
- Individual `node --check` commands for the files listed in the `build` script.
- `node --test tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`.
- `node tools/phase4_hud_verification.mjs --ci`.
- Attempted `pnpm run build`, blocked by restricted network while trying to install missing Playwright packages.
- `git diff --check`.

Remaining QA gaps:

- Full 100-answer victory and all world-transition branches were not exhaustively automated in this phase because they are long gameplay journeys. Existing progression logic was preserved, and the Phase 4 verifier covered progress, timeout, and game-over paths.
- Branded audio feedback is not yet testable because no final HUD sound assets exist.

## Phase 5 Secondary Screens QA Addendum

Date: 2026-06-28
Phase: 5 secondary screens only

Automated checks:

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct JS syntax checks | Pass | `game.js` and `tools/phase5_secondary_verification.mjs` pass `node --check`. |
| Build-script syntax checks | Pass | The files named by the `build` script were checked individually with the bundled Node executable. |
| Node systems tests | Pass | 11/11 in `tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`. |
| Phase 5 secondary verification | Pass | Required screenshots, open/close checks, focus traps, Escape behavior, RTL checks, overflow checks, persistence checks, console/runtime checks, pause flow, and results flow passed. |
| Diff whitespace check | Pass | `git diff --check` returned clean. |
| Package-manager test run | Blocked | `pnpm run build`/`test:node` attempted to install missing Playwright packages from the registry. The process was stopped under restricted network and partial install artifacts were removed. |

Required Phase 5 screenshots:

| Viewport | Screens captured |
| --- | --- |
| 390x844 portrait | pre-game, mode, difficulty, settings, progress, leaderboard, pause, results |
| 430x932 portrait | pre-game, mode, difficulty, settings, progress, leaderboard, pause, results |
| 844x390 landscape | pre-game, mode, difficulty, settings, progress, leaderboard, pause, results |
| 1280x720 desktop | pre-game, mode, difficulty, settings, progress, leaderboard, pause, results |
| 1440x900 desktop | pre-game, mode, difficulty, settings, progress, leaderboard, pause, results |

Report file:

- `docs/phase5-screenshots/phase5-secondary-report.json`

Phase 5 acceptance checks passed:

- Every secondary screen opened and closed correctly.
- Focus trap passed on every secondary screen.
- Escape closed every secondary screen and focus restored to the triggering control.
- Touch/click activation worked in the required viewport set.
- RTL document language/direction remained `he`/`rtl`.
- Nickname, character, mode, difficulty, and sound persistence remained compatible.
- Pause screen opened from an actual gameplay session.
- Results screen opened from an actual game-over flow.
- Console errors: 0.
- Runtime errors: 0.
- Checked text overflow: 0.
- Document overflow: none at all required viewports.

Manual screenshot inspection notes:

- 390x844 and 430x932 portrait sheets are compact, readable, and scroll internally where the content is naturally tall.
- 844x390 landscape remains usable with the primary actions visible and no document overflow.
- 1280x720 and 1440x900 desktop dialogs remain visually secondary to the game scene and avoid a dashboard-like feel.
- Pause and results screens preserve the maze/canvas context behind the overlay.
- Progress screen shows only stored local data and does not invent rewards or unsupported progression.

Commands run for Phase 5 QA included:

- `node --check game.js`.
- `node --check tools/phase5_secondary_verification.mjs`.
- Individual `node --check` commands for the files listed in the `build` script.
- `node --test tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`.
- `node tools/phase5_secondary_verification.mjs --ci`.
- `git diff --check`.
- Attempted `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run test:node`, blocked by restricted network while trying to install missing Playwright packages.

Remaining QA gaps:

- The Playwright package suite in `tests/game.spec.js` was not runnable because local dependencies are not installed and registry access is blocked.
- The public leaderboard branch remains a future integration path; Phase 5 verified the existing local leaderboard behavior and public/local distinction UI.
- Full victory and every world-transition journey remain long-form gameplay paths outside the Phase 5 secondary-screen verifier.

## Phase 6 Motion And UI Audio QA Addendum

Date: 2026-06-29
Phase: 6 motion and UI audio only

Automated checks:

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct JS syntax checks | Pass | `kaflul-systems.js`, `game.js`, `mobile-enhancements.js`, `poster-loader.js`, `ui/assets/asset-manifest.js`, `ui/character-animation-adapter.js`, `ui/motion/motion-system.js`, `ui/sounds/ui-sound-controller.js`, and Phase 1-6 verifier scripts pass `node --check`. |
| Node systems tests | Pass | 11/11 in `tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`. |
| Phase 6 motion/audio verification | Pass | Required screenshots, console/runtime checks, RTL checks, overflow checks, mute/autoplay checks, reduced-motion checks, hidden-animation checks, particle cap checks, and motion profiling passed. |
| Diff whitespace check | Pass | `git diff --check` returned clean. |
| Package-manager scripts | Blocked | `npm` is not available in this shell. `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run test:node` attempted to install missing Playwright packages and were stopped under restricted network. Partial install artifacts were removed. Equivalent checks were run directly with the bundled Node executable. |

Required Phase 6 screenshots:

| Viewport | Screenshot | Motion profile FPS | Long frames over 50ms |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| 390x844 portrait | `docs/phase6-screenshots/phase6-motion-audio-390x844-portrait.png` | 117.8 | 0 |
| 430x932 portrait | `docs/phase6-screenshots/phase6-motion-audio-430x932-portrait.png` | 117.8 | 0 |
| 844x390 landscape | `docs/phase6-screenshots/phase6-motion-audio-844x390-landscape.png` | 35.4 | 6 |
| 1280x720 desktop | `docs/phase6-screenshots/phase6-motion-audio-1280x720-desktop.png` | 78.0 | 0 |
| 1440x900 desktop | `docs/phase6-screenshots/phase6-motion-audio-1440x900-desktop.png` | 80.4 | 0 |

Report files:

- `docs/phase6-screenshots/phase6-motion-audio-report.json`
- `docs/phase6-screenshots/phase6-contact-sheet.jpg`

Phase 6 acceptance checks passed:

- `window.KaflulMotionSystem` and `window.KaflulUiSound` loaded in every required viewport.
- Pre-gesture UI audio was blocked with `not-unlocked`.
- Muted UI audio returned `muted` and produced no audible event.
- Reduced-motion emulation set the runtime reduced-motion state and blocked DOM particle emission.
- DOM particle creation was capped to 10 per reward profiling event.
- Hidden screen animations detected: 0.
- Console errors: 0.
- Runtime errors: 0.
- Document overflow: none at all required viewports.
- Document language/direction remained `he`/`rtl`.

Manual screenshot inspection notes:

- 390x844 and 430x932 portrait pre-game sheets are readable and stay within the viewport.
- 844x390 landscape is dense but usable, with the primary start action visible and no clipped Hebrew text.
- 1280x720 and 1440x900 desktop keep the modal centered and visually secondary to the blurred home hub.
- The final performance fix skips gameplay-canvas rendering while the menu fully covers the canvas and disables decorative menu particles on coarse-pointer profiles.

Commands run for Phase 6 QA included:

- Direct `node --check` for production and verification scripts.
- `node --test tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`.
- `node tools/phase6_motion_audio_verification.mjs --ci`.
- `git diff --check`.
- Attempted `npm run build`, blocked because `npm` is not installed in this shell.
- Attempted `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run test:node`, blocked by restricted network while trying to install missing Playwright packages; partial artifacts were removed.

Remaining QA gaps:

- Full package-manager and Playwright suite remain unavailable until dependencies are installed without restricted-network failure.
- UI sounds are generated WebAudio tones, not final branded audio files.
- Character tap/select feedback remains UI-level motion until real character animation states are supplied.

## Phase 7 Final QA Addendum

Date: 2026-06-29
Phase: 7 final QA, performance, accessibility and visual polish

Automated checks:

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct production-build syntax checks | Pass | The files named by the build script, including the new Phase 7 verifier, pass `node --check` with the bundled Node runtime. |
| Node systems tests | Pass | 11/11 in `tests/kaflul-systems.test.js`. |
| Phase 7 final QA verification | Pass | Functional flow, persistence, responsive screenshots, console/runtime checks, RTL checks, reduced-motion checks, asset fallback, memory probe, local static preview and FPS sampling passed. |
| Diff whitespace check | Pass | `git diff --check` returned clean. |
| `pnpm run build` | Blocked | `pnpm` attempted to install missing Playwright packages from npm and failed under restricted network. Partial install artifacts were removed. |
| Full `pnpm test` | Blocked | Offline mode failed because `@playwright/test` is not present in the local pnpm store. Direct Node tests and the Phase 7 CDP browser verifier were run instead. |

Phase 7 report file:

- `docs/phase7-screenshots/phase7-final-qa-report.json`

- `docs/phase7-screenshots/phase7-victory-430x932-portrait.png`
- `docs/phase7-screenshots/phase7-asset-fallback-390x844-portrait.png`

Functional checks passed:

- First-load and returning-player load.
- Nickname, character, mode, difficulty and sound persistence.
- Locked Legendary difficulty state.
- Start game.
- Pause and resume.
- Question dialog.
- Correct answer.
- Wrong answer.
- Timeout.
- Game over.
- Accelerated Adventure victory probe using a test-only runtime monkeypatch.
- Retry.
- Return to menu.
- Leaderboard open.
- Mobile orientation changes.
- Asset-failure fallback for missing character art.

Accessibility and visual checks passed:

- Document language/direction remained `he`/`rtl`.
- No required viewport produced document overflow.
- No checked Hebrew text overflow remained.
- No visible icon alignment failures remained.
- No missing accessible names were reported.
- Touch target checks passed on first-load screens.
- Focus entered the pre-game sheet and Escape closed it.
- Reduced motion suppressed nonessential particles and hidden animations.
- Results-screen actions are visible on 430x932 mobile after the Phase 7 polish fix.

Performance findings:

| Area | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 390x844 home FPS | 120.0 |
| 430x932 home FPS | 120.0 |
| 844x390 home FPS | 120.0 |
| 1280x720 home FPS | 75.9 |
| 1440x900 home FPS | 75.3 |
| Gameplay FPS sample | 81.7 |
| Initial preloaded raster budget | 4,878,944 bytes |
| Largest preloaded raster | `assets/math-maze-poster.png`, 1,849,524 bytes |
| Memory navigation probe | DOM nodes 581 -> 585, active particles 0, hidden animations 0 |

Remaining known issues:

- Duplicate resource entries are still observed for a few preloaded images, primarily `assets/bifly-player.png`, `assets/nabatick-eat-prepare-reference.png`, and `assets/nabatick-eat-reference.png`.
- Initial raster weight remains high because the poster and official logo are large PNG assets.
- Full Playwright package tests remain unavailable until dependencies are installed in a network-enabled environment.
- Final branded audio files and richer character animation assets are still missing.

Deferred improvements:

- Replace oversized PNG preloads with optimized formats and responsive loading strategy.
- Remove duplicate image decode/load paths once asset ownership is settled.
- Add real branded UI audio assets.
- Add real character animation states beyond the currently supported static/eat fallbacks.

Phase 7 changed-file summary:

- `arcade-foundation.css`: widened mobile HUD action hit targets from 38px to 40px.
- `main-menu.css`: improved mobile top-bar/touch sizing, expanded landscape handling to 960px, and made the selected-character check icon scale relative to its badge.
- `ui/secondary-screens.css`: compacted mobile results layout and moved result actions before the secondary score breakdown.
- `package.json`: added Phase 7 verifier to `build` and added `test:final`.
- `tools/phase7_final_qa_verification.mjs`: added final CDP QA, visual, persistence, reduced-motion, asset fallback, performance and local-preview verification.
- `docs/phase7-screenshots/*`: captured final Phase 7 screenshots and JSON report.
- `docs/UI_QA_REPORT.md`: added this Phase 7 report.
