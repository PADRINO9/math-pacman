## Current Preload Priority

`index.html` preloads:

- Official logo.
- Bifly menu image.
- Bifly gameplay sprites.
- Nabatick 512 reference sprites.
- Dark enemy sprites.
- Poster image.

Risk: the initial menu loads many large raster assets before the user starts gameplay. Some are necessary for immediate polish, but the order and priority should become explicit in a future asset manifest.

## Current Quality Assessment

Strong:

- Logo is high quality and matches the desired premium direction.
- Bifly, dark enemies, and Nabatick reference files are all 512x512, which is a workable source size.
- Transparent PNGs give flexible placement on canvas and menu.

Weak:

- Nabatick has multiple old generations in the repo, causing ambiguity.
- Menu placement does not use a consistent character safe area, so Nabatick appears too low in the current home layout.
- Official logo and poster are heavy for first paint.
- UI icons are not real assets/components; they are mostly Unicode glyphs.
- There is no documented asset manifest with intended role, safe-area box, crop, preload priority, and replacement status.

## Required UI Asset Set

Phase 1/2 should define or source a consistent UI asset set:

- Settings icon.
- Sound on icon.
- Sound off icon.
- Leaderboard/trophy icon.
- Pause icon.
- Play/start icon if used outside the CTA text.
- Close icon.
- Refresh icon.
- Mode icon.
- Difficulty icon.
- Profile/nickname icon.
- Score/best-score icon.
- Rank icon.
- Lives/heart icon.
- Timer icon.
- Mission/progress icon.
- Correct-answer indicator.
- Wrong-answer indicator.
- Locked/unlocked indicator.

Requirements:

- No emoji or raw Unicode glyphs as final production icons.
- Icons must be legible at 24px, 32px, and 44px touch targets.
- Provide active, inactive, disabled, and pressed states through CSS tokens or asset variants.
- Keep RTL placement explicit.

## Required Character Asset Set

Each playable character should have a consistent asset contract.

Menu states:

- Idle, unselected.
- Idle, selected.
- Pressed/tap feedback.
- Victory/celebration.
- Wrong answer/disappointed.
- Locked/unavailable, if used.
- Small avatar/headshot.

Gameplay states:

- Idle front.
- Move up/down/left/right or directional equivalent.
- Eat prepare.
- Eat open.
- Correct answer.
- Wrong answer.
- Hit/life lost.
- Combo/speed boost.

Technical requirements:

- Consistent transparent canvas size, preferably 512x512 source.
- Documented visual safe area inside the source canvas.
- Web-optimized export variants.
- No state should rely on canvas monkeypatching to choose the correct sprite.

## Required Enemy Asset Set

The dark enemy set should become explicit:

- Idle.
- Angry/chasing.
- Surprised.
- Sad/defeated.
- Optional spawn/vanish frame.
- Small UI icon/avatar if enemies are represented in missions.

Requirements:

- Consistent lighting and scale with Bifly/Nabatick.
- Safe area documented.
- Canvas and menu variants either shared intentionally or exported separately.

## Required Background And World Assets

The master spec references four worlds. The current audit confirms gameplay/world logic exists, but the visual home/menu environment is not yet a documented world-asset system.

Needed later:

- World 1 background/menu card.
- World 2 background/menu card.
- World 3 background/menu card.
- World 4 background/menu card.
- Maze tile style per world or a documented shared tile style.
- Portal/level transition visuals.
- Mission/progress badge assets.

## Required Audio Assets Or Sound Tokens

Current audio is generated through WebAudio tones. That is lightweight, but not yet a branded sound system.

Needed later:

- Named sound tokens for correct, wrong, combo, level complete, mission complete, button press, sheet open/close, pause/resume.
- Volume/mute contract.
- Mobile autoplay-safe behavior.
- Reduced-audio or mute-first behavior preserved.

No external audio files are required in Phase 0.

## Asset Manifest Proposal

Later phases should introduce a manifest file or documented table with:

- Asset ID.
- File path.
- Owner screen/component.
- Dimensions.
- Safe-area box.
- Required states.
- Preload/defer/lazy priority.
- Fallback.
- Replacement status.
- Source-of-truth note.

This manifest should be documentation-first before production code consumes it.

## Phase 1 Manifest Foundation

Phase 1 introduced `ui/assets/asset-manifest.js`.

Current manifest scope:

- Official logo.
- Poster/background image.
- Bifly menu and gameplay sprites.
- Nabatick reference sprites.
- Dark enemy state sprites.
- SVG icon sprite metadata.
- Legacy Nabatick asset candidates.

The manifest is intentionally read-only foundation data. It does not change gameplay asset loading yet. Later phases can move production loading toward this manifest after behavior and visual coverage are stronger.

Phase 1 also introduced `ui/icons.svg` with symbols for:

- settings
- sound on/off
- leaderboard
- profile
- character
- mode
- difficulty
- back
- close
- lives
- score
- combo
- mission
- world
- progress
- lock
- play
- pause
- refresh
- check
- fullscreen

Remaining asset debt:

- Some dynamic gameplay indicators still use text glyphs, especially lives/hearts and fallback symbols.
- The old Nabatick asset generations are still present and must not be deleted until verified.
- No new character animation frames were created in Phase 1.
- No placeholder art was added.

## Missing Asset Priorities

Priority 1:

- Real icon set replacing Unicode menu/control glyphs.
- Correct Nabatick menu safe-area render.
- Selected/unselected character state assets.

Priority 2:

- Complete character animation states for Bifly and Nabatick.
- Explicit enemy state set.
- Web-optimized logo/poster variants.

Priority 3:

- World-specific backgrounds and progression assets.
- Branded sound feedback tokens/assets.

## Phase 2 Home Hub Asset Status

Assets used in Phase 2:

| Asset | Current file | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Official Kaflul logo | `assets/kaflul-logo-official.png` | Used as the home identity anchor. |
| Bifly home character | `assets/bifly-menu.png` | Used as selectable character focus. |
| Nabatick home character | `assets/nabatick-idle-reference.png` | Used as a static fallback/reference-safe menu render. |
| Black enemies | `assets/dark-enemy.png`, `assets/dark-enemy-angry.png`, `assets/dark-enemy-surprised.png` | Integrated into the home scene. |
| Poster/background | `assets/math-maze-poster.png` | Used as atmospheric background only. |
| SVG icons | `ui/icons.svg` | Used for settings, sound, score, rank, mode, difficulty, progress, play, close, and check states. |

Missing or incomplete for later phases:

- Production-ready Nabatick sprite sheet with idle, selected, happy, hit, eating, losing, and directional states.
- Production-ready Bifly sprite sheet with the same animation-state coverage.
- Separate selected/unselected character lighting or shadow assets for both characters.
- World-specific home environment layers for ice, lava, ancient, and diamond worlds.
- Optimized WebP/AVIF variants for large menu art.
- Branded UI sound tokens/files for button press, selection, sheet open/close, and start-game confirmation.
- Enemy animation states beyond the current static PNGs.

Phase 2 deliberately did not add placeholder art. Static fallbacks remain in place until production assets exist.

## Phase 3 Hero Gallery Asset Status

Phase 3 adds a character-animation adapter foundation and uses only approved existing assets. No placeholder art was created.

Adapter types now recognized by `ui/character-animation-adapter.js` and `ui/assets/asset-manifest.js`:

| Adapter type | Runtime requirement | Phase 3 status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `static-png` | Browser image support only | Implemented and used. |
| `sprite-sheet` | Browser image support only | Adapter path exists; no approved sprite sheet assets yet. |
| `layered-png-rig` | Browser image support only | Adapter path exists; no approved layered rig assets yet. |
| `rive` | Optional Rive runtime | Manifest path exists; no runtime or approved `.riv` assets bundled. |
| `spine` | Optional Spine runtime | Manifest path exists; no runtime or approved Spine assets bundled. |

Supported character states from approved current assets:

| Character | Supported states | Source assets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bifly | `idle`, `eat` | `assets/bifly-menu.png`, `assets/bifly-eat.png` |
| Nabatick | `idle`, `eat` | `assets/nabatick-idle-reference.png`, `assets/nabatick-eat-reference.png` |

Missing character-animation states for both characters:

- `blink`
- `tap`
- `selected`
- `excited`
- `worried`
- `victory`
- `defeat`
- `hit`

Phase 3 uses CSS interaction feedback for tap/selected confirmation, but does not fake those as real character animation states. The adapter falls back to the approved static PNG when a requested state is not available.

Additional missing art for later phases:

- Production sprite sheets or layered rigs for both Bifly and Nabatick.
- Character-safe selected-state renders.
- Character-specific blink, tap, excited, worried, victory, defeat, and hit states.
- Final Nabatick production animation set to replace reference-status files.
- Optional Rive/Spine files only if the project chooses those pipelines later.
